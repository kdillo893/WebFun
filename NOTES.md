# Web fun
Goal of this is to create webpages that would be a fun teaching tool for kids
at the Naperville Youth Club summer camp in 2025.

Below are ideas; any taken from online sources I'll include a link where I 
found them from.

## Games?
### Tic-Tac-Toe
grid table clickable... if it's empty, the event triggers. if not, kicks back with "invalid move"
win condition would show a background or highlight on the squares where the win occurred.

Reset clears temporary store (either html elements changing with attributes or 

game state check which listens on the grid elements

### Snake
javascript would need to have game loop for drawing based on time diff from
last calculation

### ... 

## Cool demos of CSS and HTML
### Video/audio using the device's camera/mic
I should know how to do this...

### Rainbow color background transitions
Just make the CSS do a calc gradually changing over and over.

## WebGL and buttons
I saw an image of a rotating image of a 3D object with WebGL. Could have buttons
linked to JS functions that interact with objects in a WebGL pane.
